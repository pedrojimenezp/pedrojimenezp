## Interests

Information systems
I'm passionate about complex information systems—understanding how they operate, communicate, share data, and remain secure and high-performing.

Finance and Banking

I have a strong interest in the inner workings of the financial system.
I'm especially curious about how transactional services interconnect, support large-scale operations, and influence everyday life.
