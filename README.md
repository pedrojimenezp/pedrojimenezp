## My Journey in Software Engineering

### University of CÃ³rdoba

I began my journey at the [University of CÃ³rdoba](https://www.unicordoba.edu.co/), where I earned a bachelor's degree in **Systems and Telecommunications Engineering**. My thesis project was titled **SISMO**, an **Arduino-based device** designed to monitor and secure motorcycles, aimed at reducing theft in my region.

#### The solution incorporated:

- **Hardware**: [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) for device management.
- **Communication**: [MQTT protocol](https://mqtt.org/) for real-time data exchange.
- **Backend**: A robust server to register devices and track motorcycles in theft scenarios.

This project sparked my love for innovative problem-solving and cutting-edge technologies.

During my university years, I also developed a comprehensive ticketing, logistics, and vehicle management system for a regional transport company. This platform enabled:
- Ticket generation for users.
- Customer and employee records.
- Vehicle fleet tracking and insurance management.
